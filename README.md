## Welcome
we’re glad you’re here!

If this is your first time contributing to the project you’ll need to get a few things out of the way:
* Become a contributor on our GitHub Org https://github.com/AITestingOrg 
* You can e-mail Patrick or Justin for this at patrick_alt@ultimatesoftware.com or justin_phillips@ultimatesoftware.com
* Sign up on our Slack group at http://aitestingorg.slack.com
* Sign up on the contributors page on https://www.aitesting.org
    * Go to Members and sign with the “Contributor” dropdown option.

Once you have done that you will be free to start helping out. We highly encourage you to attend the meetings we hold with the group you are interested in and participate in Slack conversations.

If you are starting a new project please follow our naming and tech stack guidelines <link to guidelines>. To work on existing projects all you need to do is know how to use GIT and create GitHub Pull Requests ( https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ ).
