## Agenda

- Abstracting Data Points
- Went over Cross Validation with Drop, Label Addition, Neural Net (not really)
- Abstractor Demo
    - Concrete examples, abstraction detection
- Some limitations to email generator
- Labels (generalization)
- UI to train system??
- Entire forms in the future (i.e. generalizing entire forms such as contact forms, group forms)
    - Each form element to the entire form
    - Initially manually tell form type, eventually AI should be able to generalize
- **Main goal currently: get it to train faster**
- Form naming conventions?? (no metadata in HTML)
- Validating content of input fields as well **
