# 02/16/2018

## Action Items
- **Super Action Item:** Andrew Ng (Coursera) Machine Learning/start looking into AI/ML
- Microservices common dependencies
- Come up with serious configuration standards, document that well
- Read Tariq’s dissertation (Juan presents/trial run)
- Make a video that introduces microservices for new incoming team members
- Create onboarding document for specific components (to keep meetings high-level) - Jose/Erin
   - Make it easier for people to jump onto stories
   - Look through GitHub

## Agenda
### Microservices Overview (Banking Service)
- Using the Axon Framework
- Common libraries practice
- Event Sourcing
   - Amqp Config (exchange queue, RabbitMQ
- CQRS overview with commands and queries
   - CustomCommandHandlers, CommandHandlers, EventSourcingHandler, etc
- Testing using the Axon Framework (fixtures, given/when/then, etc)
- Repository is on GitHub, be sure to look at it
- Use Tariq’s email for Travis/Docker
	
## Trip Service
- Currently in progress still (Jose/Erin)
- Start creating branches

## Authentication
- Is up and working
- Configuration service/option (to configure whether to use authorization or not)
- Database (users/passwords)
- Set up document/how to work authorization

## Standards
- Use Trip Service as standard in creating microservices (Gold Standard)
- Make documentation around that (put in GitHub)
   - API, connecting databases, logging, docker-compose, config scripts/server (Juan working on config server)
- Careful of copying from Ulti Docs

## Documentation
- We need more
- How to configure, how to stand up service (in different ways), how to set up service for debugging
- Spring library for swagger (clean swagger properties)
- Start putting in minutes in GitHub documentation

## Deployments
- Volunteer to research public clouds for us to use (Patrick wants to do it, or not??)
   - We need this soon (for conferences, testing, etc), since we have a group on DockerHub for AIST (start publishing containers soon)

## Other
- Docker compose (should have two)
- Eventual TODO: Build and save all test results (to put unit tests into training models, map them to labels)
   - Make bugs eventually in the future (labels, begin building models for AI in the future)
- Linear Regression, Neural Nets
- Training material? 4 hours of massive brain dumping information from Justin
